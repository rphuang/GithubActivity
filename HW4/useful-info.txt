a port mapping and explicitly pick a port

"docker ps -a" to see all running docker processes

Type “docker port *SHA*” to see the port that Docker with identifier

Normally it will run on “localhost:32770” (and you can check there), but for some
Docker installations the default ip is different: type “ docker-machine ip default ”

Type “docker rm *SHA*” to kill a Docker with identifier *SHA*
○ Add the “-f” (force) flag to kill one that is still running, which you will often do if
you detached it when you ran it
○ Delete an image with “rmi” instead, also using its SHA
